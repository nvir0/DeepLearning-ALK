# Good evening for the last time!

So lets start with:
1. Any questions, concerns or thoughts from our last lecture? 
2. So one from me, what did we talk about last time? 
3. And, what problems do we encounter when training models for vision?

Some quick terms to repeat:
1. CPU
2. GPU
3. Cloud Computing
